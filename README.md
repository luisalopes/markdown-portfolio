## Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Communicating Using Markdown

### Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through.

Hey there! If you wanna check out more about who I am and what I'm aiming to do here, please check out my luisalopes repository's README.md; I wrote quite an extensive **About me** there and I'm sure it explains a whole lot more than this smaller README here.

This is my markdown portfolio, where I come whenever I want to add new changes to old documents written when I first did the Learning Lab Markdown course ~~or whenever I really just want to write away into the void~~.

### I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I actually have a ko-fi and I am just throwing it in here so I don't have to copy once more in the future when I actually have something to show.

~~To be quite honest I'm in a bit of a pinch and need some money but I don't have much to show or offer so I'm not asking anything, I'm just desperately wishing someone throw me a couple bucks and that's it.~~

Feel free to contact me to give some tips or just to comment on my overall chaotic learning assignments.

See ya soon!
